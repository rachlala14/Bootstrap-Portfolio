# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description 

I continue to build my portfolio using Boostrap CSS Framework.

I have created folder structure, navigation bar, hero section, work section, skills, contact and about me sections.

This portfolio site is a work in progress, and I will add to it when I continue to gain experience!
